NVIDIA has patched five bugs in its Windows GPU display driver, three of which could allow an attacker to execute code on the system. Users should patch now.

The bugs affect Windows versions of the display drivers for GeForce (gamer-class), Quadro (professional workstation-class), NVS (multi-display business graphics), and Tesla (high-performance computing) GPUs.

**They could all lead to denial of service, but the three highest-severity flaws of the bunch are the ones that could also lead to local code execution on the target system.**

Customers should install the GPU driver patches through NVIDIAâ€™s [driver downloads site](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).

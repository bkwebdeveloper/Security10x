Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Adobe Photoshop CC, the most severe of which could allow for arbitrary code execution. Adobe Photoshop CC is a graphics editor program. Successful exploitation of the most severe of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker executing arbitrary code in the context of the affected application. Depending on the privileges associated with this application, an attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If this application has been configured to have fewer user rights on the system, exploitation of this vulnerability could have less impact than if it was configured with administrative rights.

**THREAT INTELLIGENCE:**

There are no reports of these vulnerabilities being exploited in the wild.

**SYSTEMS AFFECTED:**

· Photoshop CC 19.1.8 and earlier

· Photoshop CC 20.0.5 and earlier

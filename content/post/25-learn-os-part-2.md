In operating systems, files and folders or directories are organized in a hierarchical directory tree. 

You have a main directory that branches off and holds other directories and files. We call the location of these files and directories, paths. Most paths in Windows looks something like this `C:\Users\Cindy\Desktop`.

> In Windows, file systems are assigned to drive letters which look like `C:`, or `D:`, Or `X:`.

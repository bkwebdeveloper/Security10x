<h3 style="text-align: center;" markdown="1">The Course</h3>

We will focus more on the practical aspects of the operating system. Not only will you learn how to use the Windows and Linux OSs, I'll also teach you how to interact with these operating systems through the command line. 

Remember that the command line inputs text commands instead of relying on a graphical user interface or GUI. If this is your first time using a command line for any OS, you may find this a little intimidating at first. That's totally normal, but you'll be well on your way to become a command line wizard by the end of this course. 

What to expect from this course:

1. How file systems work on Windows and Linux
2. Assigning user permissions and roles on Windows and Linux
3. Package managers for Windows and Linux
4. Installing OSs on a lot of machines at once. 

And, much, much more!

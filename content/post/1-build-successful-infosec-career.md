### Information Security
This is an advanced discipline, meaning you should ideally be good at some other area of tech before entering it. This isn’t required, but it’s common and it’s ideal. The three areas that infosec people normally come from are:

1. System Administration
2. Networking
3. Development

Here are the basic areas you need to get from either university, trade school, or self study/certification:

1. Networking (TCP/IP/switching/routing/protocols,etc.)
2. System Administration (Windows/Linux/Active Directory/hardening,etc.)
3. Programming (programming concepts/scripting/object orientation basics)

You can use the certification study books as teaching guides. They’re quite good at showing you the basics. Here are some examples:

- A+
- Security+
- Linux+
- CCNA

### Resources
<br>
Note:

> It’s very important to focus on an area of hacking that is interesting & exciting to you. Focus on that one area and pick up new things as you go, but don’t try to be the “ultimate hacker” and learn everything. The greatest hackers on Bugcrowd have specialities and areas of interest, but they don’t know how to hack everything.
<b>Hacking is a lifelong journey of learning.</b>

This is a list of resources that can be helpful to researchers that are just getting started, or those that want to improve some core aspects of their research and reporting. Please let us know if you have any suggestions for resources that we should add to this post!

<b>Step 1) Start reading!</b>

[The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook](https://portswigger.net/web-security): This is an absolute must-read and considered the web-app hacker’s ‘bible’. This book starts from square one, walking you through getting Kali Linux installed all the way through using tools and finding exploits.

<b>Step 2) Practice what you’re learning!</b>

[Hacksplaining](https://www.hacksplaining.com/exercises): This is a great site to learn a bit more about various web hacking techniques and how they’re done. It’s actually more of a practical walk-through. Super useful!

[Penetration Testing Practice Labs](http://www.amanhardikar.com/mindmaps/Practice.html): This site has a massive list of practice apps and systems for several hacking scenarios. Use this list to find new testing labs and sites to practice your skills.

<b>Step 3) Watch tutorials on YouTube!</b>

[DEFCON Conference videos on YouTube 996](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference/videos):
Watch all of the talks from DEFCON over the years. Very useful resource.

[Hak5 on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/Hak5Darren/playlists):
Hak5 typically focuses on hardware hacking, but in addition to that they also have the ‘Metasploit Minute’ show, HakTip: NMap and much more.

[LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcE-kVhqyiHCcjYwcpfj9w):
LiveOverflow has so many basic to advanced tutorials.

[JackkTutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/JackkTutorials/videos):
Jackk has created many tutorials that walk you through CSRF, XSS, SQL Injection, Target Discovery and much more.

[Awesome-Infosec](https://github.com/onlurking/awesome-infosec):
This is a curated list of helpful security resources that covers many different topics and areas.

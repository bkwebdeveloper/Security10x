Germany’s national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-Bund) has **[issued a security advisory](https://www.cert-bund.de/advisoryshort/CB-K19-0634")** to alert users of VLC media player of a severe vulnerability affecting this extremely popular open-source software.

> “A remote, anonymous attacker can exploit the vulnerability in VLC to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, exfiltrate information, or manipulate files,” said CERT-Bund, which also discovered the security loophole.

The memory-corruption flaw is known to reside in the player’s latest release, 3.0.7.1, but may also be present in its earlier versions. It affects the program’s Windows, Linux and UNIX versions and has earned a score of 4 out of 5 on the German agency’s severity scale.

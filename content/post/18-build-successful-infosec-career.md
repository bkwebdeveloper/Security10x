**Information Security** is an advanced discipline, meaning you should ideally be good at some other area of tech before entering it. This isn’t required, but it’s common and it’s ideal. The three areas that infosec people normally come from are:

1. System Administration
2. Networking
3. Development

Here are the basic areas you need to get from either university, trade school, or self study/certification:

1. Networking (TCP/IP/switching/routing/protocols,etc.)
2. System Administration (Windows/Linux/Active Directory/hardening,etc.)
3. Programming (programming concepts/scripting/object orientation basics)

You can use the certification study books as teaching guides. They’re quite good at showing you the basics. Here are some examples:

- A+
- Security+
- Linux+
- CCNA

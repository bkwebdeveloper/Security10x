The US federal government plans to establish a system that will let people report vulnerabilities securely and anonymously. DEF CON will host the SecureDrop servers for the program. SecureDrop is open source software that some organizations use to receive anonymous tips. The vulnerability reports will go to the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), which will share the information.

This approach makes sense for encouraging reporting of vulnerabilities found in US Government systems, but not for general reporting of software vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities found in private industry systems. Direct reporting to vendors (or through the managed bug bounty programs many of them have), or reporting to ISACs is already widely done and already works well. Adding another stop along the way will not add any value – where value is measured by reducing the time any vulnerability goes unfixed.

This reporting solution aligns with plans to have CISA distribute more threat information to the private sector. It is not clear how this reporting mechanism meshes with existing reporting or bug bounty efforts already in place without introducing delays or reduction in fidelity of the reported flaws.

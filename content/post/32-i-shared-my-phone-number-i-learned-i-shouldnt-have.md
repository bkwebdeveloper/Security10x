**How your phone number exposes you.**

It took only an hour for my cellphone number to expose my life.

All that Mr. Tezisci, the researcher, had to do was plug my number into White Pages Premium, an online database that charges $5 a month for access to public records.

In an hour, this is what came up:

- My current home address, its square footage, the cost of the property and the taxes I pay on it.

- My past addresses from the last decade.

- The full names of my mother, father, sister and aunt.

- My past phone numbers, including the landline for my parentsâ€™ home.

- Information about a property I previously owned, including its square footage and the mortgage taken out on it.

- My lack of a criminal record.
